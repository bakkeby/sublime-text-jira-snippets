==================
Jira Code function
==================
This can be used to add a {code} block around the selected text. Copy and tailor this snippet if
you primarily add code snippets for specific programming languages.

Usage:
   Trigger the snippet via Tools > Snippets..., via keybinding or tab complete

Example keybinding:
   {
      "keys": ["alt+c],
      "command": "insert_snippet",
      "args": { "name": "Packages/User/jira_code.sublime-snippet" },
      "context": [{ "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "source.jira" }]
   },

Expected results:
As an example the following string
   hello code
would be changed to:
   {code:|title=}
   hello code
   {code}
-->
